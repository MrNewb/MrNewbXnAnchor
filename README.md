This is an edit to xnanchor to use ox_lib

Smallo made an awesome anchor script but I wanted to use it with ox_lib, this is a very small edit with his permission to post for more of the community to use.
This will add the anchor command with checks on speed when setting it and will integrate with the ox_lib radial to add/remove the anchoring options.
